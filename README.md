## Hi there !!! Welcome on my profil ! 👋

Hi my name is Kevin, I'm 33 years old and I'm French.
I'm infographist and I'm learning now, the programmation languages to expend my knowledges and curiosity.
 
- 🌱 I'm currently learning Javascript and Java.

- 💬 Ask me about :

I have been graduated in 2013 as infographist DTP (Desktop Publishing) and later moved into the 3D alone as auto learner with videos. I have been passionnate of this art, and to be able to create artificial environments, objects and characters.

I also moved a bit on the web development and knew the basics of HTML5 and CSS. As I said early on my profil, I joined a classroom for 1 year to learn some others languages in programmation for my own.

I do prefer to progress with my own rythm and not be stressed by time and useless things who can waste my time.
